        <p>On the faithfull days of 06.11.1983 a homeless heavy pug mom in the making was wandering the streets of downtown Boston to find shelter.</p>
        
        <p>In a lonely alley she found a dumpster where earlier on that day a disgruntled CEO just dumped all their old and obsolete tech hardware and coding manuals etc.</p> 
        
        <p>The tired pregnant pug made her way into the dumpster where she lay her head to rest on a AI manual from Andrew NG. Her full of future puppers belly was warmed by a book about hardcore vanilla Javascript.</p> 
        
        <p>The weather was turning bad, rain and lightning started lash near that alley. Out of excitement the poor pug started to go into labor. Before the first baby pug started to come and lightning struck the dumpster and the pug with her unborn litters were energised by many thousands of volts of electricity.</p> 
       
        <p>The moment the lightning struck strange symbols flashed before the suddenly opened minds eye of the pug in labor.</p>

        
<code>var Pregnant_pug = 1;
var Lightning = 1;
var Techy_dumpster = 1;

if (Pregnant_pug === 1 && Lightning === 1 && Techy_dumpster=== 1) {
  alert=("You'll give birth to a bunch of smart ass puggers"); }
        
else () {
  alert=("There is no else, it was destiny!!!(coding paradox alert)")
  }</code>
        
        
        After being energised by exotic extra dimensional particles she gave birth to 12 healthy pug puppers. Unfortunately the mom died after the last birth. Giving everything she got to the last atom of her intelligence to all the puppers equally. Very sad folks.  It was not long after that all 12 pug puppers were adopted by a typical american family of Trump supporters. Because they go bigly when adopting stuff.</p

        <p>Pugone formally know as pug 1 at the age of 6 months saw some fallen spectecles on the floor. A strange sense of curiosity came over him as he stared at the object that he realised was formerly on some humans face.</p>
        
        <p>He trusted his face right onto the glasses and lifted his head. The spectecles stayed on his head. So miraculous he thought. A shimmering of light bursted in his brain and the  pug 1 evolved into Pugone realised he was meant for greater things then scratching his butt on the floor.</p> 
        
        <p>A strange language suddenly appeared in his mind. Signs and words began to form in a coherent structure that suddenly made more sense to him than the pupper toys around him.</p> 

        <code>var First_code = "Here i am, Pugone. The first pug who codes!!!"
console.log(First_code);
        
/*What happened to hello world!... O well never mind :(*/</code> 
        
        <p>Pugone then became the first of the twelve to become enlightened. He then vowed to help inlighten his brothers & sister puggers.</p>

        <p>The name Pugaruto was given to the pug that snug into the room of one of the owners children whom had fallen asleep with Naruto on one screen and a 10 hour long hackathon on the other.</p>
   

        <p>Needless to say, the pug was captivated by both. He found himself tasking each eye to watch one of the screens. After that he took to the streets wearing a Naruto outfit screaming random variables to passersby. Variables such as the following.</p>

        <code>var anima = "Naruto";
          var pugaruto = "Narutolover";</code> 
        
        <p>Pugaruto took his new obsession a little far the first few weeks. Human street goers weren't feeling safe anymore with this pug expounding a new ninja religion of coding and strange paw movement no sane person could understand. He calmed down after a while though and took a job creating a chatbot answering Naruto related inquiries.</p>

        <p>Pugs generally like trash. They like to roll in it. Sometimes to even eat it. Even though eating trash should be against their better judgement. But for an unenlightened pug whom did not had food for 3 days because his brothers and sisters always steal it, there was no option.
        </p>
        <p>So Micropug formally known as pug + (random number 1- 12) found himself an old windows 95 manual in the basement and helped himself nicely on its multitude of textured microfibers.</p>

        <code>var windows = "very tasty";
              alert("wow, suddenly feel that this old computer needs to be upgraded to windows vista")</code> 
        
        <p>After eating the manual Micropug started reprogramming windows 95 to windows 9000....... A product which would be released in the year 2989. Since nothing makes sense here, why should time.</p>

        <p>Pug nr: x of 12 was watching his favorite youtuber named Pewdiepug. Suddenly the screen of his computer showed an error message when loading the next Pewdiepug vlog 156. On the screen was writeen "due to article 13 of eu regulation of copyright privacy bla bla etc etc."</p>
        <p>Pur nr: x then decided he could not let this happen. He grabbed a nearby black trashbag, wrapped it around his next and marched to Brussels to take matter into his own paws</p>

        <p>Once arrived he stormed the senate or whatever they call this shitty old farts meeting place and with few words in code he changed the law.</p>

        <p>The neighbours of the family of the 12 pugs were an old married couple whom used to be proffesors. One days pug nr: x sneaked inside to steal some candies. But he got caught. Luckely the coupld did not called the police, since in the USA it would mean being instantly shot in the face which would be bad since a pugs face already looks like something someone has been punching at for hours.</p>
        <p>So the old couple let the pug stay from time to time. To feed him biscuits also during their weekly old intelectuals meeting where a dozen old folks discuss important topics about life while sipping tea. </p>

        <p>So at one point one of those old humans dropped his spectecles. 
        The pug quickly snagged them with his paw and gently putted it on his face as a human would do to the surprise of the onlookers and said.</p> 

<code>var fallen_spectecles = "Part of the club Pug";
var pug = fallen_spectecles.includes("Pug");

}</code>
        <p>The old humans were smart, but to old to question this new emerging inteligence superpower whom has risen amongst them. The one with the lost glasses eventually turned blind because he could not find his glasses.</p>

        <p>This one is a bit far fetched in terms of origin stories. The other ones are more realistic (not really). This one pug with really bad eyesight whom was already given some spectecles caught the playstation unattented. Big mistake by owner. Pug nr: x started bashing the joystick with his paws. Things started to move on the screen and he started to see patterns of bashing and the moving of the characters. He quickly learned to beat all high scores of x amount of games. He managed to trace the origin of this screen magic to a black box with japan written on it(very small letters but he could still read it because of those big ass spectecles and o yes he could also read all of a sudden, get over it). So ever since he started learning about Japan and its culture and technology.</p>
        <p>He also say saw the movie the last samurai with Tom Cruise.
        He tought it was a good movie but could not understand why humans cutting so much meat did not eat anything of it</p>

        <p>So a question started to form in his mind...</p>

<code>var humans_with_sword = "meatchoppers";
var humans_hungry = false;
var hum = humans_with_sword.includes ("meat");

if (hum == true && humans_hungry == false) {

else {

}</code> 
        
        
        <p>After studying Japan's violent history, he was a bit shocked. However learning that Japan is now one of the most non-violent peacefull nation on earth restored his faith again in the culture of Japan.</p>

            <li>an unattentive pug owner</li>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>One of the children of the owner usually went to the library on friday. Since pug nr: x was one of the most silent ones, she decided to take him along on the trip to the library. </p>
        <p>The pug fell asleep as the child human was reading through her books. As the child was so engrossed in the material she was reading. She forgot the pug and left for home. Back at home she went to bed believing the pug went back with her. Anyways with 11 pugs remaining who would really notice right!</p>

        <p>So the pug remained even after closing time. So he was there all alone in the weekend. He had nothing to do so started looking at the books around them and contemplated why they were there. What made them so important that humans spend so much time with them. He was determined to find out this great mystery. So he crawled his way up some racks with books and started watching them, outside and inside, upside down with some sniffing.</p>
        
        <p>He found the smell of programming books rather interesting. They just had this smell about that kindled his curiosity. So he searched all the coding & programming books...</p>
        
        <code>var books = ["Happy Potter", "code for you", 
          "pug sized code snippets", "my little puggy", "Dragon ball P", 
          "programming distilled", "dragon fire", "pinokio did not do it", 
          "AI for babies", "bitcoin sucks", "legends and the mists", 
          "what to cook when your broke", "coding demoisterised", 
          "programming for the elderly", "code" ]
var codebooks = (books.includes("programming","code") > -1);


if (codebooks == true) {
    console.log("wow this library has coding books");
}
else {
    console.log("This is a library for dummies");
}

var count1 = books.toString().match(/code/g).length;
var count2 = books.toString().match(/programming/g).length;
var countfinal = count1 + count2;
console.log("Wow, there are " + countfinal + " books that i am interested in!");
</code> 
        <p>So after some weeks of going unnoticed Libropug just kept reading all the coding and programming books he could find. Then after seeing how stupid the library caretaker was, he bit him in the leg, making him unable to work, thus effectively taking over his job as caretaker. Libropug the librarian he was nicknamed. Folks visiting the library did not question what had happened. They were just greatfull they now have a more fascinating librarian.</p>

        <p>This one pug nr: x just was born with intelligence, or well because of the lightning strike of course. He just had one problem, he was one lazy ass pug. So instead of coding things himself, he just copied other poeples code and wrote the comments himself, at least some originality right.</p>

        He did not had any moral complications with this workflow. Being a starbucks pumpkin spiced latte lover he justified that he worked hard and needed the caffeine. Well nobady really questions someones authenticity when one slurps his pumpkin spiced latte while staring with wattery eyes at VS code on his macbook pro thinking what to comment. 

        <code>/*Man its getting late*/
/*Shit, that pug ass bitch at table 7 is looking suspiciously at me*/
/*Better squint my eyes and look at that damn code*/</code> 
        Such imposters are never questioned when having the starbucks/apple/pugfaced stamp written all over them.

        <p>Usually there are not many individuals cut out for the CEO life. Perhaps it is a small percentage of the population. It seems that small percentage hitted one of the 12 puggies. From an early age Pugeo liked to micromanage his brothers and sisters lives, when they eat, when they sleep and where. No one dared to interfere in this since it would result in hous arrest and stuff or taking all the cuddles for himself excusing himself that eventually those cuddles would trickle down to the others, even though that does not make sense.</p>
        <p>So at one year of age. This particular pug decided to just walk into one of silicon's valley top startups and dragged out the current CEO by his pants. The onlookers were so stunned that they simply accepting their new ruler and started carying out Pugeo's orders right away.</p>

        Pugeo started programming a formally to collect everybodies good ideas on their computers, so he can pick the best ones and pretend it was his idea by presenting it on pig IT events.

        <code>var muggleideas = [
"AI goggles", 
"automated diapers", 
"AI powered toaster", 
"smart mouse", 
"Itable", 
"AI jacket", 
"smart shoes",

"AI bottle", 
]

var Pugeoideas = muggleideas.filter(muggleideas => muggleideas.includes("AI"));

console.log("These are all Pugeos ideas: " + Pugeoideas);</code> 
        
        With the above code Pugeo became even more succesfull. He eventually bought 100 yachts and fitted them with weaponry to start his own navy.

        <p>Obviously at least one of 12 tech savy pugs needs to be an Apple fanpug. Otherwise statistics just would not add up. So on one faithfull night when one sleepy puggy was taking a nap on a Macbook pro, another clumsy pug, it was actually Pugeo since he is an asshole. tipped a glass of water on the macbook pro. The device then went short circut and the battery got discharged all at once straight into the napping puggie.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, from that day forward Pugapple was glued to the macbook pro chasing away the original owner of the device. He managed to repair it with its new found knowledge of Apple technologies that he received during the incident. </p>

        Pugapple actually was more into python. So now code will be written since this shit is about javascript. 

  
        
        Also Pugapple found himself enjoying a pumpkin spiced latte at starbucks while watching Procrastopug avoiding to work.

        <p>The 12th pug was kind of the coolest of the pugs, even before Elon Musk adopted this pug.
           The legend goes as follows. This pug was wandering around the launch pad on 02.03.2019 of the falcon 9 launch with Crew dragon. He say some small blue sphere being carried into the capsule. He mistook it for his own toy and ran after it into the dragon. No one really knows how he got up there, he must have climbed or something, or hitched a ride in a mechanics jacket.</p>
        <p>After finding that blue sphere in the dragon capsule, he realised it was not his and he wanted to leave again, but they closed the door ready for launch. The pug kept its head cool during launch sitting on Ripley lap. This would also be the first pug in space.</p>

        After he returned to earth after eating all the foot on the ISS Elon decided to adopt the pug, Elon was also secretly jalious because the pug went into space before him. Crew Dragon was also officially Pug certified by Nasa. 

        <code>var pug = "the 12th coolest pug in a ?"
var ElonsPug = pug.replace("?","Dragon V2 Crew verions")

alert:(ElonsPug);</code> 
        Thus Elons Pug came to be. 
        
        Oh and you might be wandering, where is the eleventh pug. Well he ran away before i could write his legacy. Makes no sense but i don't care. Bye.
